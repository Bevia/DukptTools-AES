Absolutely, Vincent! Here's a comprehensive `README.md` file summarizing your AES-DUKPT simulator, covering the key concepts, setup steps, and usage. You can drop this directly into your project root:

# üîê AES-DUKPT Simulator

This Kotlin-based simulator demonstrates how to perform secure PIN encryption and decryption using **AES-DUKPT Format 4**, compliant with [ANSI X9.24-3]. It's designed for high-assurance financial environments using **AES-256 + CBC mode** and supports realistic key derivation and PIN block handling.

---

## üì¶ Features

- AES-DUKPT key management with 256-bit BDK
- Format 4 PIN block generation (fixed 16-byte block)
- CBC-mode encryption with secure IV handling
- Session key derivation (IPEK ‚ûù transaction key)
- Real-time PIN encryption and decryption simulation
- PIN masking for secure logging
- Error handling for validation and crypto issues

---

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Crypto Provider**: BouncyCastle
- **Mode**: AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
- **Format**: ISO Format 4 PIN block (16 bytes)

---

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Register BouncyCastle Provider
Add this at app startup:

```kotlin
Security.addProvider(BouncyCastleProvider())
```

### 2. Run the Simulator

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val simulator = DukptSimulator()
    simulator.runSimulation(pin = "5678", pan = "4012888888881881")
}
```

Note: PAN is used for metadata only, not embedded in Format 4 PIN blocks.

## üîë Key Components

| Component           | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `generateBdk()`     | Generates a 32-byte AES-256 Base Derivation Key    |
| `generateInitialKsn()` | Provides 16-byte Key Serial Number (KSN)            |
| `DukptAES.deriveIPEK()` | Derives the IPEK from BDK and KSN using AES-CMAC |
| `AesTerminalSimulator.encryptPin()` | Encrypts Format 4 PIN block using AES-256 CBC |
| `AesHsmSimulator.decryptPin()`      | Decrypts encrypted PIN block using AES-256 CBC |

---

## üîê Format 4 PIN Block Structure

| Byte Index  | Content                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| 0           | Format ID (0x04)             |
| 1           | PIN length                   |
| 2‚Äì13        | PIN digits + `0x0F` fillers  |
| 14‚Äì15       | Random entropy bytes         |

Always returns a 16-byte block ‚Äî no padding required pre-encryption.

## üß™ Testing Notes

- AES encryption uses a secure IV per transaction.
- Logs show masked and unmasked PINs for debug (can toggle).
- CBC mode ensures no ciphertext repetition.
- PAN is only used for display, not embedded in Format 4 block.

---

## üìÅ Future Enhancements

- Add support for Format 1 blocks (legacy interop)
- REST API wrapper with payload validation
- Full ANSI-compliant session key derivation paths
- Key rotation and multi-terminal simulation
- JUnit test suite for transaction verification

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Warning

This simulator is intended for **educational and testing purposes only**. Never expose real PINs, keys, or logs in production without proper HSM-backed protection and compliance checks.
